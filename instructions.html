The name of the game is Drone-Aid.The objective of the game is
to drop materials to a remote island in the Asian pacific that 
was just affected by an earthquake. You will be delivering the 
materials using a drone. Delivering the materials are tricky, 
due to the tall cell towers on the island, they often cause drones
to crash in to them.
Your mission should you accept is to deliver as many materials
to the island avoiding the cell towers. Each grid square provides 
you with a number that represents the points you will earn and the 
number of towers that square is touching. Your goal is to aid at
least 1300 people. If you hit a cell tower it will  negatively your 
score and the amount of people you have aided because they will have
to use materials dropped off by the  drones to fix the cell towers.
Good Luck!
