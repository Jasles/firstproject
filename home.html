                    The name of the game is Drone-Aid.The objective of the game is
                    to use a drone to deliver materials remote island in the Asian Pacific that 
                    was just affected by an earthquake. Delivering the materials will be tricky, 
                  there  are tall cell towers near the drop off loctions with the highest populations.
                 You will need to avaiod the cell towers or the drones can crash into them or be damaged. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>

                    Your mission should, you accept is to deliver as many materials
                    to the island while avoiding the cell towers. Each grid square provides 
                    you with a number that represents the points you will earn and the 
                    number of towers that square is touching. Your goal is to aid at
                    least 1300 people. If you hit a cell tower it will negatively impact your 
                    score and the amount of people you  have aided because they will have
                    to use the  materials to fix the cell towers instead of repairing the island.
                    <p>
                    Good Luck!
