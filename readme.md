The name of the game is Drone-Aid.The objective of the game is to drop materials to a remote island in the Asian pacific that was just affected by an earthquake. You will be delivering the materials using a drone. Delivering the materials are tricky, due to the tall cell towers on the island, they often cause drones to crash in to them.
Your mission should you accept is to deliver  as many materials to the island avoiding the cell towers. Each grid square provides you with a number that represents the points you will earn and the number of towers that square is touching. Your goal is to aid at least 1300 people. If you hit a cell tower it will negatively your score and the amount of people you have aided because they will have to use materials dropped off by the drones to fix the cell towers.
Good Luck!
