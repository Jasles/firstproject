The name of the game is Drone-Aid.
The objective of the game is to drop materials to a remote island in the asain pacific that was just affected by an earthquake. You will be delivring the materials using a drone. Delivering the materials are tricky, due to the tall cell towers on the island, they often cause drones to crash in to them. 

Your mission should you accept is to deliver as many materials to the island avoiding the cell towers. Each grid square provides you with a number that reporesents the points you will earn and the number of towers that square is touching. 

Your goal is to aid at least 1300 people. If you hit a cell tower it will negativiely affect your score and the amount of people you have aided beacuse they will have to use materials dropped of by the drones to fix the cell towers.
